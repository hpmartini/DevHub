# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **code-server Integration**: VS Code in browser alongside Monaco Editor
  - Toggle between Monaco (lightweight) and VS Code (full IDE) modes
  - Configurable via `VITE_CODE_SERVER_URL` environment variable
  - Configurable iframe timeout via `VITE_CODE_SERVER_TIMEOUT` (default: 15 seconds)
  - Resource limits to prevent excessive consumption (2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM max)
  - Health check for code-server container
  - Comprehensive security documentation for HTTPS setup

- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Path traversal validation for directory access
  - Separate sudo password option for code-server (`CODE_SERVER_SUDO_PASSWORD`)
  - Enhanced iframe sandbox security (removed `allow-same-origin` flag)
  - Password security requirements and documentation

- **Error Handling**:
  - Error boundary component (`WebIDEErrorBoundary`) for crash protection
  - 15-second timeout detection for iframe loading failures
  - Retry functionality with proper iframe reload

- **Accessibility**:
  - ARIA labels for all interactive elements
  - Proper roles for button groups
  - Screen reader support for editor type switcher

- **Developer Experience**:
  - DEV-only console logging to reduce production noise
  - iframe cleanup when switching back to Monaco
  - Memoized functions and values for better performance

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Docker volume mounts changed from hardcoded `/Users/hape/` to `${HOME}/` variable
  - Migration required: Update your `.env` file or docker-compose overrides
  - API service: `/Users/hape/Projects` → `${HOME}/Projects`
  - API service: `/Users/hape/PROJECTS` → `${HOME}/PROJECTS`
  - code-server: Consistent mount paths with API service
  - **Action Required**: Restart containers after pulling this update

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: `CODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` must be set - container won't start without it
- Removed hardcoded default password from docker-compose.yml
- iframe sandbox now uses stricter isolation (no `allow-same-origin`)
- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks

### Fixed
- Path mapping now correctly handles nested `Projects` folders
- iframe error detection with timeout fallback (onError doesn't reliably fire)
- Retry button now properly reloads iframe
- Console logs only appear in development mode

### Documentation
- Complete setup guide with security best practices
- HTTPS configuration options (Caddy, Nginx, SSH tunnel, Cloudflare)
- CORS documentation for cross-origin scenarios
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Migration guide for volume mount changes

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- DevOrbit Dashboard - Developer application monitoring
- Monaco Editor integration
- Terminal panels with PTY support
- Browser preview panel
