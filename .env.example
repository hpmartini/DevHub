# ============================================================================
# code-server Configuration (VS Code in Browser)
# ============================================================================
# SECURITY CRITICAL: This password protects access to your ENTIRE codebase
# via the browser at http://localhost:8443
#
# PASSWORD SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
# ✓ MUST be at least 12 characters long
# ✓ MUST include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
# ✓ MUST be unique (don't reuse passwords from other services)
# ✓ MUST NOT be committed to version control
# ✓ SHOULD be stored in a password manager
#
# EXAMPLE: Use a password generator to create something like:
#   Xk9$mP2#nQ7@wL5&
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
# - Anyone with this password can read/write ALL your project files
# - They can execute arbitrary commands with sudo privileges
# - They can access environment variables and secrets
# - They can modify your codebase without leaving traces
#
# NETWORK SECURITY:
# - By default, code-server is accessible only on localhost
# - NEVER expose port 8443 to the internet without HTTPS
# - Use a VPN or SSH tunnel for remote access
# - Consider using a reverse proxy with SSL (see README for HTTPS setup)
#
# REQUIRED: You must set this to a secure password - container will not start without it!
CODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=

# OPTIONAL: Separate sudo password for code-server (recommended for security)
# If not set, sudo will be disabled in code-server (recommended)
# Only set this if you need sudo access within code-server terminals
# WARNING: This grants root-level access inside the container
CODE_SERVER_SUDO_PASSWORD=

# code-server URL (optional, defaults to /code-server/)
# Use relative path when running in Docker (proxied through nginx)
# Use http://localhost:8443 for local development without Docker
VITE_CODE_SERVER_URL=/code-server/

# code-server iframe load timeout in milliseconds (optional, defaults to 15000)
# Increase this if your code-server takes longer to start
VITE_CODE_SERVER_TIMEOUT=15000

# PostgreSQL password
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
